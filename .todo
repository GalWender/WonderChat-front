create the inner nav of chats
for now just create text chats 
already added collection to db

participants of channels are so that they show up on both sides 
channel members can add people to the channel via chat nav aswell as right clicking on channel itself 

chats don't have participants

messages will have their own collection in db
messages (each one) will be associated with the chatid 

added chats, need to make little changes and render nicely 




implement add text chats with the modal
implement messages via sockets
add the header bar for chat name
